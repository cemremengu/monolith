# Security Configuration

# The secret key used for encrypting sensitive information (API keys, passwords, auth headers, etc.) stored in the database.
# This should be a long, random string (32+ characters recommended).
# Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
# IMPORTANT: Changing this value will make previously stored sensitive information inaccessible.
SECRET_KEY=

# The secret key used specifically for signing authentication tokens.
# Should be different from SECRET_KEY for security best practices.
# Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
# IMPORTANT: Changing this value will invalidate all existing user sessions (users must re-login).
TOKEN_SECRET_KEY=

# The maximum lifetime (duration) an authenticated user can be logged in since login time before being required to login. Default is 30 days (30d). This setting should be expressed as a duration, e.g. 5m (minutes), 6h (hours), 10d (days), 2w (weeks), 1M (month).
LOGIN_MAXIMUM_LIFETIME_DURATION=30d

# The maximum lifetime (duration) an authenticated user can be inactive before being required to login at next visit. Default is 7 days (7d). This setting should be expressed as a duration, e.g. 5m (minutes), 6h (hours), 10d (days), 2w (weeks), 1M (month). The lifetime resets at each successful token rotation (token_rotation_interval_minutes).
